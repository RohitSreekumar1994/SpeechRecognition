The universe is incomprehensibly large in size and dimension. It contains everything that exists from the Tiniest subatomic particles to the galactic superclusters. Nobody knows how big the universe is, but astronomers estimate that it contains about 10 billion galaxies, each comprising an average of 100 billion stars.
